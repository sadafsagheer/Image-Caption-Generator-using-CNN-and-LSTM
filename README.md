# Image-Caption-Generator-using-CNN-and-LSTM
This is a Deep learning project using Flickr8k dataset from Kaggle.


Download and extract Flickr8k_Dataset.zip and Flickr8k_text.zip.
Now, create a folder named 'ML' in root directory of your Google Drive.
Then upload extracted version of Flickr8k_Dataset and Flickr8k_text into the ML folder. This will take times depending on your connectivity.
Also upload the testing_caption_generator.py into ML folder.
Now create a notebook in Colab by your preferred name, and copy paste from ImageCaption.ipynb
Run all the shells. 
Then Other files like description.txt,tokenizer.p etc will generate when you run the shells one by one.
